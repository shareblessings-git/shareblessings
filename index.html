			<h1>Share Blessings</h1>
			<p>Coronavirus has been a blessing in disguise for me..
				 Thanks to Covid 19, I have been able to spend  some quality time with the people close to my heart.
				 I belong to an industry which might take the longest to recover post this pandemic, however there are still a lot of positive takeaways for me from this.. 
				 While we, sitting comfortably on our couches are busy forwarding funny memes and quotes and munching 6 times a day, my heart goes out to the ‘not so blessed’ out there on the struggling to make the ends meet for their food for the day. 
				 While we crib about being locked down in the comfort of our plush apartments, they are on foot, ready to walk the miles to reach their hometowns without food or shelter 
				 Pandemic or no pandemic, we have more people dying with hunger in India than any other disease.
				 So with an intent to make some positive difference in their lives, I take an initiative to reach out to like minded people who would want to contribute to our platform called “Share Blessings”
				 Each one us has to contribute an amount of only JUST Rs 100 per month and help us feed the poor each day of the month. 
				 With this step, we aim to reach out to a larger audience and try and feed as many people as possible..
				 My endeavour would be to help you get tax benefits on the same as well however, will come back with details on the same 
				 Meanwhile, please reply to my text with a YES to help me know that I can count on you for thiS.
				 Hoping for your support with folded hands.
				 Jai Hind ...
